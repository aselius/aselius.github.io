## Based on:

This page / modified theme is based on the Flexible-Jekyll theme found [here](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll/)

## Installation:

Fork the ``master`` branch and delete ``gh-pages`` branch in it. This is important because ``gh-pages`` branch is used here only to host the blog. You should be using the master branch as the source and create a fresh ``gh-pages`` branch.

## Personal Todos:

- Create sub links that will change views from default (writing) to others
- Hamburger for dropdown of these sublinks
~~- Import over content from wordpress~~
~~- Delete rest of placeholders for personal content~~
