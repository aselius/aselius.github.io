I don't know where to begin. The morning began with a lot of turbulence. I forced myself to bed quite early the evening prior because of the flu I had picked up while flying out of state a couple days earlier, but woke up with a terrible headache, a torn up throat, and a shivering cold from the nightsweats. The flu really reaaly had taken its toll on me. I don't know how I was making sane judgements; maybe I wasn't. A lot of things had happened this day. The president the *real.donald.j.trump* had gotten impeached, most of my teammates at work went on vacation till the end of the year, my friend had texted me over night that he didn't get the job offer from an interview he had recently had, and I had yet again put myself into a spiral of worry and anxiety.

Setting the other interesting events aside, what was causing me to be so nervous? And why the hell am I writing about it here? What the heck is this blog supposed to be about anyway?

### Oh the panic
I dont really get panic attacks. Well the kinds that start showing physical symptoms anyway (or I have yet to see myself get one). So whenever I panic, its usually all in the mind. It usually goes like this. I try to make a decision. Then I get extremely nervous about making the decision because of the different consequences that decision will have created. I worry about how that will both positively and negatively impact me. I worry about how that decision would ultimately make me feel; make others feel. And its a long repetitive process of creating a pros and cons chart in my head, wiping it clean because I think some point is invalid, and repeat. So after this process, when its finally time to make a decision I am often stressed because I don't really have an answer in mind. Although I'd thought of the decision through A LOT OF TIMES. Oh hey does this sound familiar? Then you have fine taste in TV series üòÇ

If you still are unsure what I'm talking about, [have fun!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4955642/)

But I don't really suffer from picking a froyo flavor like Chidi does in the show. Although I will admit that sometimes picking a restaurant for lunch sometimes is as hard as teaching my cat vector calculus. But yeah, put er there - I admit, decisions overwhelm me sometimes. Especially ones that will change a major axle of your life - Ones where you may have to part with loved ones, ones where you may double your net worth, ones where you can be closer to family (whether that's a good thing or not is different per individual i suppose üòõ).

The House made that decision yesterday night. I had to make mine today. Well, somewhat.

### The Decision is mine to make
The decision I was making was nowhere near the magnititude of the articles of impeachment, no way. But it would certainly impact me, my close friends at work all of whom I appreciate whole heartedly, my coworkers and manager who have been very good to me, and.. maybe my folks because they worry more than me. (Yeah I know.) I decided to leave my current job. Not because I was in a rusty relationship with anyone. But because of a couple of reasons. I won't really go too much into detail as to why but to scratch the surface, I can list 2 reasons.

First is that I'm kind of the only one physically distant from most of my team members and the conflict thats been creating in the areas my professional development as well as social relationship. That's straightforward if you will.. or it might sound like utter gibberish. I don't know. I'll leave it at that.

Second is that I havent really experienced a full bandwidth of whats out there. Well shit, that's really vauge. I'll give you an example. If you work at a rapid prototyping environment and you've been doing that for a while, how would you handle scaling that prototype to meet the demands of 100x the user base you originally prototyped for? Would you enjoy doing that work? Or would you rather be doing the rapid prototyping? How would you know what your preference is and where your skills are at? You wouldn't know until you try that out right?

On the opposite spectrum, the biggest pull factor for me to stay was really the relationships I've formed at my current workplace. Most of the friends I made at my current workplace have been some of the most happy, wholesome, genuine people for some odd reason! And this was an incredibly difficult choice to make because we are all social animals right? Sure I'll keep in touch after my leave, but it won't be the same.

So yeah that was the decision that's been worrying be keeping me awake at night. I still have doubts. It's been driving me nuts. I annoyed the crap out of some friends that have known me for a while, and a couple of people that feels like the type you would say "I'm not sure why I'm telling you this, but.." to. Of course no one can tell me what to do they can offer their input and advice but all in all, the decision was and still is mine to make, and well.. yeah duh obviously. But yeah that's why I was Chidi today with a giant giant stomachache.

### So why is this up here?
That was a long introduction. Since I really inteneded on publishing before the day actually ended, before my usual bed time. I'm going to have to keep the main beef of it succinct. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'll do better on the following posts.
So yeah this got me thinking about why decision making sucks. Computers are much much better decision makers than we are. Just think of a simple decision tree (CART). It can just classify into buckets just like that. Whereas how we value different conditions or metrics is very multi-dimensional and cannot just be split conditionally. So naturally some questions came up in my head. This is why this post is up here, so I can share the context and some of the shower thought type questions that intrigued me. These were

- Can technology help us get there in terms of helping us how to decide so that we can be less anxious of the choices we make in the world?
- Does a statistical learning model accurately capture the different dimensions of individuals to provide personalized assistance for decision making?
- How do you even measure the accuracy of such a decision engine?
- Is creating a semantic map of a person something that could get us there?
- Does Emergen-C actually do anything?

The questions probably fall towards the field of ethics in AI, and is probably more "airy" or "soft" than many would like but hey, I'm sick and probably cant make logical decisions; todays been a hell of a day; i'm getting emotional already thinking of the friends I'll miss; and now I'm really tired. I'll go to bed being uncertain for another day.
