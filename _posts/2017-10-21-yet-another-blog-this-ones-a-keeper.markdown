After the past couple of failed attempts at a general blog at blogger, and a tech/day in the life of blog on a wordpress template, here I am. If you landed here from a Google search, or from Linked-in or wherever I leaked this domain to, I would like you to consider the following about this blog:

---

1. I am **NOT** going to be focusing too much on formal writing. Please excuse my colloquialism, moderate internet slang, not so pitch perfect grammar, et cetera.
2. I am **NOT** trying to offend anyone, or be too controversial about anything.
3. I am trying to document a lot of things I pick up, feel about, and experience throughout life.
4. I will try to keep most of my posts that are mainly words under 1000 words, so that all the distracted people like me won’t have too much trouble.
5. I am not trying to start a tech blog. This will have a lot of tech stuff in it, mind you, but will have a lot more than just the latest flavor of the month I’ve been crazy about. Hacker News or Medium is better for that.
6. I may be opinionated and may from time to time fume about certain topics. But I mean, this is my personal blog. Refer to rule 2.
7. It is **NOT polished**. Don’t complain too much about the delayed animation on the hamburger, the “ill” responsive design and what not. The intention here was create a simple static page with Jekyll. I’m not getting paid to design a scalable and responsive web app.
8. The blog maybe broken from time to time as I play around with the template. Please keep that in mind.. I’m not trying to be unprofessional here, it’s just “Time is money, friend.” I don’t have enough time to keep this blog polished. Refer to rule 7.

I mostly decided to write again because more and more I’ve been having difficulties tracking my journey as a professional, and I really wanted to document my brand as an engineer. If you find any erroneous thoughts or concepts in my blog please feel free to email me, or leave a comment down below :D
