description: Its not like I moved anywhere interesting without internet for the past 2 years. I just kind of lost sense of why i wanted to blog in the first place and the piece i was working on at the time was interesting, but it just fell off my radar.

Yeah, I'm still here. No huge life event really happened that made me stop writing. I didn't suddenly move to a remote island off the coast where I didn't have any access to any cell signal. I start this blog a wee bit before September 2017 when I looked at my old wordpress blog and thought: well that looks mildly shitty. I went into some hostgator wordpress extension I had set up at the time and tried to put together the pieces of writing I had in my old blog. By October I took a template I liked, added/removed some stuff and had my first piece of writing up.

Forward 2 years, and its almost the end of 2019. A lot has happened. And I almost had the exact same moment as I did in 2017, but I'm not going to just toss this whole blog in the can and start over again from scratch. (I mean I'm confident that I could cook up something beautiful this time but who's got the time..) Well what's so bad about this blog? Well first off, the font is kind of shit. I can't seem to tolerate it past the 10th word in a post. It doesnt feel very easy to read on the eyes even without my millennial filter on that prevents me from paying attention past the very first paragraph. The layout is kind of a mess and it doesnt make use of the given device space. And why did I think it was clever to make a post dated on my birthday detailing my upbringing!! So cringey.

Anyhow, I just wanted to reflect on the past 2 years real quick, tell the world I miss my cat, and then memo what I will be blogging from now and for what purpose.

But first of all, DAMN I MISS MY CAT. I had to part with the furball for a little bit.

What was I doing in 2017? Or rather leading up to late 2017?

1. I was really engrossed trying to nail down "practical" "job-ready" training programs. No offense, I still love MooCs. But I think I fell for the very easy trap thinking that all I had to do to shift my career from general software to something like deep learning or robotics was to know how to tinker with the tools and really just nod at some of the instructional content going over the background knowledge. Yeah no. I really enjoyed those programs I took, and I still have it at the corner of my resume, but I didn't really learn too much aside from just being able to brag occasionally that I wrote this cool piece of software (when in reality, I just wrote one algorithm in a really cool platform environment that other engineers have already built for the course.)

2. I was really a master of none and never focused on nailing one thing down. It was always: oh this library or tool looks kinda cool - briefly looks over documents - tinkers around a little bit - moves on. Going by this logic. If I was really a master of all the little things I dabbled in from 2017 till now, I'd be a unicorn 10x Machine Learning Engineer that can build a damn successful AI startup all by myself. Heh.

3. I copied and pasted a lot of things without using my lazy ass brain to fully evaluate if that was what I actually needed. I looked and tried to do tutorial after tutorial to try and emulate other's answers to achieve what I needed to do. Never looking at official docs for long (god forbid the source code) to try and figure out what I was dealing with. Without a lot of technical leadership around me guiding me towards better practices, it was difficult to get out of this tutorial to tutorial mentality.

It all sounds really negative (I think?) but it is true that the various choices I have made around that time put me in the shoes of a self inflated ego with raised expectations yet still without anything tangible to obtain what I thought I deserved.

So what have I been doing lately? How is that different?

1. Let's break it down into topics. In terms of software, little by little I've been getting better at software craftsmanship: Extreme programming, test driven development, refactoring, learning more about Python as a programming language. For AI and ML, I've finally gotten around to start reading Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman), and have started learning Neural Nets from scratch (perceptrons) instead of tackling a head first Keras RNN approach.

2. Patience! Instead of jumping the gun and attempting to write code from the first hour, I allocate a lot more time to designing and thinking about the approach I want to take. The joy of creating is still up there, but ideating, planning and designing is just as fun and should always be given priority!

3. I read documentation quite a bit. I'm really glad I was able to work on open source for my day job (well till 2018 anyway). Reading and writing documentation is actually quite enjoyable :o (who would have thought). I would love to go attend the Write the docs con in PDX someday. I'm also now more comfortable navigating a new codebase and source code reading isnt as dreaded as before haha.

So yeah some things are different. I still drink coffee. Still enjoy good beer. But I guess I matured and i'm not just talking about my age ü§£. Urgency is important sure in some cases, but craftsmanship isn't achieved overnight. That's probably the biggest difference.

Back in 2018, I was really looking to getting into the AI/ML space, and I was presented a decent opportunity to do so. I wanted to focus more on the data science aspect of AI and ML but at this point, I suppose this transformed a little bit. My ideal career path seems to be heading towards becoming a MLE.

There's never enough time to be good at absolutely everything. But a change in perspective helps deal with feeling helpless. (well it's been helping me anyway üëê) Widen your perspectives and understand the landscape a little bit first. Deepen your understanding in one field, and eventually improve upon other areas that are correlated to your core expertise.

So now it comes back to this blog. Why am I blogging, and what will I be blogging about?

Writing is an important skill all engineers should have. It is a way of communicating your idea, and it helps people understand your idea, product or whatever cool thing you've made. Both technical and non-technical writing is a skill. I can't say I'm good at both (let alone one of them). So yeah that's kind of why I'm blogging.

I'm not going to be blogging about simple and widely spoken topics or how to guides that a lot of people have already written good pieces about (although I .. plan on finishing that A* piece since I was so close to finishing up the draft for the latter parts!!!). But this isn't to say I'm going to be writing about niche things that no one has written before. If there is something that I do that catches my attention - (for example: something I've been doing wrong for a long time that I've recently discovered a better solution for)
