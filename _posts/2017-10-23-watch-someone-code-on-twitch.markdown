title: Watch Someone Code on Twitch?

description: This post is about why I started watching Casey code a game from scratch using C lang. I always wanted to learn more about low level programming, game dev, and graphics and audio. So I'm finally taking this thought into action! # Add post description (optional)

Wait what? I am doing what now? Yes, I decided that I would spend maybe an hour everyday if not a couple of days in a week to watch some guy code on Twitch.

>Now, you might be wondering why I decided to take on such peculiar endeavor. Shouldn’t I be watching Overwatch streams or something instead? 

## Context.. well, some of them anyway

Ha, let us start with a couple of premises.

#### Low level language

I have always been rather weak in understanding what happened in the background when I coded in a high level language. I mostly write Python for my day job, and as we all know, Python being an interpreted language has to go through the interpreter and execute line by line. And sure.. I’ve written C++ in a certain point in my life. I had to write C lang and C++ for a graduate course I took, and when I was curiously attempting to program a game from scratch, I was writing some C++ (The remnants remain somewhere deep within my GitHub if ye dare look). I’ve recently had to write some C++ also for my Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree, and I have to say! There is a special feeling of writing statically typed low level language. There is less of that ***“UHHHH, why did that just work?”*** moments surely, and as much as debugging with gcc and gdb is an eyesore compared to using something like PyCharm or pdb, I had more understanding of the code I had written and had clear expectations of the behavior of most parts of my code.

#### I have a BS in Biomedical Engineering

Also, I don’t hold a CS or CE degree. I don’t have a stronger foundation on operating systems, data structures, and programming abstractions as I would have liked to have gotten straight out of college. Sure, I’ve learned a thing or two over the shoulders of other software engineers, but this doesn’t really make me an expert.

#### Ahh the good old days of Starcraft Usemap making

With that being said, I’ve always been fascinated by game development. I always wanted to know how a graphic engine was written up, how audio input output worked, and really how to make games more complex than an ascii roguelike dungeon crawler. I think I have retained this craving to create a game of my own ever since my starcraft (Brood War, not II) use map creating days back when I was like 11.

## So why am I doing this?

So why the context about C lang and game dev? The twitch stream (or more so the archive currently sitting in Youtube since I am way way behind to just dive into the livestream itself) is about game dev; to be more specific, it is about creating a game from scratch, without using engines like Unity or Unreal, just like how all games were made way back in the days (Quake anyone?). The project is called [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/), and I have just started to sift through the introduction.

A couple of things I noticed was the depth of knowledge required for game development. Sure, not every game dev has to have a strong command of low level programming knowledge like Assembly, but the material Casey covers include things like explaining logical cores and virtual cores, registers, how C code is translated to Assembly code and things like this that scratch a lot of the itches I have been having (the 3 points I talked about above).

Well is it completely realistic for me to follow approximately 405 hrs of content he has out there? Sur...e, uhhh, lol probably not. However, I want to follow up to the point where I feel comfortable about a lot of things I talked about above. I was surely moved by a blog post he had written in the past that happened to have climbed up to top 50 on Hacker News about how **‘Object Oriented Programming’** is **‘horseshit’**. I tend to stick around for at least a little while.
